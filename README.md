# Algorithm-implementations

## insertion-sort.py
### How does it work?

Insertion Sort (I'm going to call it "the algorithm", I don't want to type too much), sort one element at the time. It's not efficient on a large number of data.
### Then where you can use it?
* If you have an almost sorted data set, it will be a lot faster than any algorithm.
* It can sort the data set while it receives it.
* It's really simple to implement, you can create a three-line version of it in C.

## insertion-sort-nonincreasing.py
It's the same as the 'insertion-sort.py', just a reversed verison.
